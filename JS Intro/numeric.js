/*Data Type - Number/Numeric

	Includes all possible numeric values including NaN
	(Not a Number), positive infinity and negative infinity.
	Do not enclose with a quote or a double quote.
	NaN is generated when a math function fails or when trying to parse
	a number fails.

	NaN is the only value in JS that does not Equal itself.
	The surest way to determine if something in JS is NaN is to compare
	it against itself. If it returns false it is NaN(Not a Number)

	We use numbers/numeric data-type for computations.

*/


	let number3 = 5
	let number4 = 6

	console.log(number3 + number4)
	//JS will properly compute the numbers if the data-types are correct.
